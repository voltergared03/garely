# Changelog

All notable changes to Garely are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project currently
ships `beta` tags ahead of a 1.0 public release.

## [1.25.0-beta.15] — 2026-09-17

Claude can read your meetings, and deleting a colleague no longer leaves them on their tasks.

### Added
- **Connect Claude (or any MCP client) to the workspace.** Settings → Profile issues a personal
  token; point Claude at the workspace and ask it to go through the meetings — it can search
  transcripts, open reports, pull decisions and tasks. It sees exactly what you see: an admin
  reaches every meeting, everyone else only the ones they ran or attended, and never outside
  their organization. Tokens are listed with their last use and can be revoked one by one.
  Creating one now shows the whole connection — address, header, ready-made command and config
  block — not just the naked secret.

### Fixed
- **A deleted colleague stayed on every task they were assigned.** Task assignments hold a bare
  user id with no database link back to the person, so deleting an account left the assignments
  behind: a nameless avatar among the assignees, and — on each task they led — no responsible
  person at all, which also left the ClickUp routing with nobody to send the task to. Deleting
  a user now clears their assignments, their collaborations and the assignee column in one
  transaction, and the leftovers from earlier deletions have been cleared out.
- **Claude's connector dropped the connection right after it was added.** It asked for a newer
  revision of the protocol than Garely offered and hung up on the spot, and three of the probes
  it makes on connect were answered with errors — including a sign-in prompt for an
  authentication method Garely does not run.

### Known issues
- **MCP is still rough.** The connector does not always survive a refresh, and hosted clients
  can go quiet after a few failed attempts — re-adding the connector is the way out for now.
  Treat it as a preview rather than something to lean on.

## [1.25.0-beta.14] — 2026-09-11

### Fixed
- **The language column on the Users list cut its own value short.** After the columns were
  tightened for the Departments column, "Русский" read as "Русс…". The column has the room it
  needs again, and the row still fits the card with the ClickUp column showing.

## [1.25.0-beta.13] — 2026-09-11

Meetings that arrive from Google are announced, and a person can be in more than one department.

### Added
- **A person's departments on the Users list.** Membership was always many-to-many, but the
  only way to put someone in two departments was the Departments tab, one department at a
  time — and the Users list showed no departments at all, so it read as "one per person".
  The list now has a Departments column: a chip per department, click to tick any number
  of them. The invite dialog takes departments too, so a new colleague lands in the right
  places before their first sign-in.

### Fixed
- **Meetings imported from a Google calendar were never announced.** A meeting that reached
  Garely through a connected calendar got no invitation, no "meeting updated" when the event
  was dragged to another day, and no bell — Google only mails the guests the organizer chose
  to notify, and on a shared team calendar that is usually nobody. A monthly call sat on
  nine people's calendars for two weeks without a single email. Imported events with guests
  now get Garely's invitation with the join link and .ics; a change of time, duration or
  title sends "meeting updated", and a time change also rings the in-app bell for every
  participant — from the calendar and from the edit dialog alike. When several sync runners
  see the same revision at once, exactly one of them sends the mail.
- **The Users table overflowed its card** once the Departments column arrived: status and
  actions were cut off and every email wrapped. The card is wider, the columns tighter,
  emails stay on one line, and the tablet layout carries the new column too.

## [1.25.0-beta.12] — 2026-09-09

A meeting's switches are no longer set in stone the moment it is scheduled.

### Added
- **Editing a scheduled meeting now includes the "AI and communication" switches.** Live
  transcription, the AI report, task creation and guest access could only be chosen on
  the create page; the edit dialog — from the calendar or the dashboard — showed title,
  time, agenda and participants and nothing else, so changing a switch meant deleting
  the meeting and creating it again. Both dialogs now carry the same card as the create
  page, pre-filled from the meeting. A switch that was off stays off in the editor. On a
  meeting already in progress the card says what applies when: transcription and guest
  access change on the next join, the report and task settings when it ends. Changing a
  switch does not send a "meeting updated" mail — only a change of time, duration, title
  or participants does.

## [1.25.0-beta.11] — 2026-09-07

ClickUp stopped answering twice in a day, and each time it was us asking too much at once.

### Fixed
- **The ClickUp list picker in Settings went blank, and task deletion failed, whenever
  ClickUp was busy.** ClickUp allows about a hundred requests a minute, and everything
  Garely did with it drew from that budget with no coordination. Clicking between the
  Users, Departments and Integrations tabs re-read every Space, Folder and List on each
  click — nine times in thirty seconds was enough for ClickUp to refuse, and the picker
  showed an error for six minutes. A run of task deletions ran out the same way and came
  back "deleted partially". Now every request goes through one shared queue, a refusal
  is waited out rather than given up on, and the list of ClickUp lists is read once and
  shared by every tab for five minutes. When ClickUp is limiting, the picker shows the
  last known lists with a note that they may be incomplete, instead of nothing.
- **A task deletion could time out in the browser and still finish on the server.**
  Deleting waits for ClickUp first, and under load that wait could pass the sixty
  seconds the proxy allows — the browser reported a failure while the server carried
  on and removed the task anyway. Deletion now gives up within its budget and says so;
  the task stays until a retry succeeds.

## [1.25.0-beta.10] — 2026-09-07

Recording without a browser, and a meeting that could be moved out from under the
person already in it.

### Changed
- **New meetings no longer create tasks automatically.** The switch is off for every
  new meeting unless the workspace setting turns it on — and that setting now actually
  applies. Meetings imported from a calendar had been ignoring it and creating tasks
  regardless.
- **Recording no longer needs a browser.** The audio recording of a meeting used to
  run inside a headless Chrome that drew close to three CPU cores for sound alone, and
  twice the server killed it mid-meeting for exceeding its budget. It now records
  through the LiveKit SDK at about one core, so the box has room for the call, the
  transcription and the recording at once. The LiveKit versions are pinned so an
  accidental upgrade cannot break the pairing.
- **Keyboard focus is visible on text fields.** Search boxes, the chat and the shared
  notes in a meeting, and the task editor all suppressed the focus ring; tabbing through
  them showed nothing. The ring now shows on keyboard focus, as it already did elsewhere.
- **Under the hood, the twenty-two heaviest screens keep their styling in stylesheets
  instead of inline in the markup** — no visible change, but a colour or spacing
  decision can now be changed in one place instead of hundreds.

### Fixed
- **Moving a meeting that someone had already joined broke it.** If an invitee opened
  the room early and the host then changed the time, the meeting stayed "in progress"
  at the old time, the visitor was never told, and the moment they left it was marked
  finished — so at the new time it sat in the archive and nobody could join. A false
  start like that is now reset: the room closes, the early visitor lands in the lobby
  with the new time, and the meeting goes back to "scheduled" as if it never happened.
  A meeting that is genuinely in progress — people talking, a recording running —
  refuses to be moved and says so; end it or create a new one.
- **Someone already waiting in the lobby saw the old time** after the host moved the
  meeting. The lobby now re-checks and says "the host moved this meeting — it now
  starts at 15:00".
- **The "now" line in the calendar did not move.** It was drawn once on load, so after
  an hour with the tab open it pointed an hour into the past. It now advances every
  minute and re-syncs when you return to the tab.
- **Three people in a call left an empty quarter of the screen.** The grid opened a
  fourth slot with nobody in it; the third tile is now centred on its own row.
- **A failed save in the meeting editor on the dashboard said nothing.** The dialog
  just stayed open. It now shows what the server said, as the calendar's editor
  already did.
- **The transcription agent had a memory cap below what it uses at idle.** Raised, so a
  long meeting no longer risks having its transcriber restarted mid-sentence.

## [1.25.0-beta.9] — 2026-08-27

Things the app knew were wrong and did not say.

### Added
- **An admin can block an account instead of deleting it.** Until now the only way to cut
  somebody's access was to delete them — which also stops their mail for good and removes
  them from the meetings they were invited to. That is right for someone who has left and
  wrong for someone on leave, on notice, or under review, where the work has to stay put
  and only the access should stop. Blocking signs them out on every device immediately and
  keeps everything else exactly as it is; unblocking restores access. You cannot block
  yourself, or the last remaining admin.

### Changed
- **Clearer wording throughout, in both languages.** Messages that named a condition now
  say what happened and what to do about it — "no connection to the server" instead of
  "network error", "give it a title" instead of "title is required". The Ukrainian also
  had a genuine word-choice error on the sign-in, two-factor and password screens, and
  three different apostrophe characters that rendered differently from one screen to the
  next.

### Fixed
- **On a phone, the calendar opened on the oldest meeting in the workspace.** Seeing what
  was coming next meant scrolling past everything that had already happened. The mobile
  agenda now starts at today; finished meetings live in the Archive, which is its own
  page. Overdue tasks are not swept away with the past — they are lifted to the top,
  since they are the one thing behind you that still needs doing.
- **After midnight the calendar mislabelled the days.** With the tab left open overnight —
  normal on a phone — yesterday's meetings still said "Today" and today's said "Tomorrow".
  The date is now re-checked at midnight and whenever you come back to the tab.
- **Shared notes in a meeting said "Saved" when they were not.** A rejected save or a
  dropped connection still printed "Saved at 14:32", so notes could exist only in the
  writer's own browser while everyone believed they were kept. It now retries once, then
  says plainly that it has stopped saving — and shows the last time it really did, so you
  can see how much is at risk.
- **A forgotten meeting kept running after it was marked finished.** Ending a stale
  meeting only updated the database; the video room stayed open, and with it the
  transcription and its per-minute cost, while the app showed the meeting as over. The
  room is now closed too.
- **The "My meetings" tab in the archive did nothing.** It highlighted and left the list
  unchanged. It now filters to meetings you called or took part in — and only appears for
  admins, since everyone else already sees just their own.
- **A meeting could be created twice from one calendar event.** Google's push
  notification, the ten-minute sync and reconnecting your calendar can all run at the same
  moment; two of them landing together each created the meeting. The database now permits
  only one, so the duplicate cannot happen rather than rarely happening.

## [1.25.0-beta.8] — 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- **A meeting recording was lost mid-call, and nothing said so.** A 52-minute meeting kept
  only its first four minutes: the recorder was shut down by its own CPU guard because the
  configuration under-declared what recording actually costs, and a job that outgrows the
  budget it declared gets killed. The budget now matches reality, with room to spare.
  This does not recover the lost file, but it stops the same thing happening again.
- **A failed recording is now visible.** The meeting page showed nothing at all — exactly
  what it shows for a meeting nobody recorded — so the loss above went unnoticed for hours
  by the person who went looking for it. A failure now says so on the meeting page, and
  says plainly that the transcript and the report are complete and unaffected, because
  that is the first thing anyone wants to know. The meeting's organiser and the admins are
  notified as well, rather than finding out by accident. A recording still being assembled
  now says so too, instead of looking like a failure.
- **Buttons that did nothing.** Creating a meeting could fail with no message whatsoever —
  the button stopped spinning and the page simply stayed put, which is indistinguishable
  from a broken button. Saving a meeting edited in the calendar did the same when the
  title was empty. Both now say what happened, and a rejected save shows the reason
  instead of discarding it.
- **Meeting form errors are now attached to their field.** The date and time messages were
  printed next to the input rather than connected to it, so screen readers announced them
  as loose text belonging to nothing.
- **Unreadable badges on the light theme.** Status badges — "Google SSO", the pending-request
  count, the department lead crown, the language tags — were pale text on a pale tint, close
  to invisible on a white card. They were built for the dark theme only; each now has a
  light and a dark form that flip together.

## [1.25.0-beta.7] — 2026-08-26

Forms now explain themselves. Second half of the interface rework.

### Fixed
- **The invite form did nothing when the address was empty.** Clicking "Invite" with a
  blank email produced no message and no reason — it read as a broken button rather than
  a missing field. It now says what is needed, and checks that the address is actually an
  address, which it never did before.
- **Errors now point at the field that caused them.** Changing a password showed a single
  line at the bottom of the form, so it could not say whether the current password was
  rejected or the new one was too short — the one thing you need in order to fix it. The
  same applied to registration and to setting a password from an invite link. Each error
  now sits on its own field, and "the two passwords do not match" appears on the box you
  retype, not on the one you already got right.
- **Password rules no longer disappear as you type.** "At least 8 characters" lived in the
  placeholder, which vanishes at the first keystroke — exactly when it still needs reading.
  It is now a permanent hint under the field.
- **Dropdowns you cannot see into.** Choosing where ClickUp and Linear file their tasks was
  a dropdown over two options, hiding both behind a click; both choices are now visible.
  The AI model list, which can run to hundreds of entries, can be typed into to filter
  rather than only scrolled.
- **Waiting screens now show what is coming.** Departments and database tables draw the
  shape of the list while it loads instead of a spinning circle, so nothing jumps when the
  content arrives.
- **Failures no longer interrupt with a dialog box.** A rejected role change, a refused
  delete or a dropped connection during a call used to raise a modal that blocked the page,
  could not say which row it belonged to, and — over a live meeting — stole focus from the
  video while everyone else kept talking. They now appear as a message beside the work.

## [1.25.0-beta.6] — 2026-08-26

### Added
- **A light theme.** Garely now comes in light as well as dark, with the switch in
  Settings → Profile: System, Light or Dark. "System" follows whatever your computer is
  set to, so it turns dark by itself in the evening if your machine does. The choice is
  remembered per device — the office monitor and the laptop on the sofa can disagree —
  and the page opens straight into your theme with no white flash on the way. Dark stays
  the default for everyone who does not choose otherwise.

### Fixed
- **Deleting someone did not stop their email.** A person removed from Garely kept
  receiving meeting invitations, reminders and full meeting reports, with no account left
  for an admin to remove a second time. Their address survived on the calendar events they
  had been invited to, and the calendar sync kept reading it back in as an outside guest.
  Deleting an account now stops its mail for good, and clears the person out of the
  meetings they were invited to. Re-adding somebody with the same address works as before.
  A blocked account no longer receives mail either — until now it was cut off from signing
  in but still sent invitations with a join link.
- **The app can be used from the keyboard.** There was no visible focus indicator
  anywhere, so tabbing through a page left you guessing where you were, and the dropdowns
  ignored the arrow keys entirely — which meant settings pages could not be filled in
  without a mouse. Dropdowns now respond to arrows, Home/End, Enter and Escape, and every
  control shows where the focus is.
- **Faint text in the dark theme.** Secondary labels sat below the accepted contrast
  minimum, one of them at roughly half of it, which made them hard to read on a laptop
  screen in daylight. Both are now brighter.

## [1.25.0-beta.5] — 2026-08-13

### Fixed
- **ClickUp stopped talking back to Garely, and nothing said so.** For five hours this
  afternoon, work done in ClickUp never reached Garely: statuses stayed as they were,
  renamed tasks kept their old titles, and deleted tasks stayed on the board. ClickUp had
  blocked the connection after Garely answered too slowly too many times, and the check
  that exists to repair exactly this kept reporting everything was fine — a blocked
  connection looks identical to a working one unless you ask ClickUp how it is doing.
  The slowness itself is gone: Garely now confirms receipt straight away and does the work
  behind it, and a burst of changes to the same task costs one lookup rather than one per
  change. The same delay sat in front of every signed request, so a busy stretch in ClickUp
  could briefly make the whole of Garely unresponsive for everyone; that is fixed too.
  The half-hourly check now notices a blocked connection and restores it on its own.
  Nothing was lost in the meantime — the hourly catch-up sweep kept task statuses correct
  throughout.

## [1.25.0-beta.4] — 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- **One person glancing into a meeting could end it before it began.** If somebody opened
  a scheduled meeting a few minutes early, realised it was the wrong one and left, the
  meeting was marked finished — often at the very minute it was supposed to start, so
  everyone arriving on time found a closed meeting. A report was then written from those
  few seconds of silence, and sent out by email with its tasks.
  Garely now recognises an abandoned attempt: a session that was short, where nothing was
  really said and nothing was captured. Such a meeting quietly ends without a report and
  without notifying anyone. Everything else is treated as a real meeting — including
  meetings with transcription switched off, ad-hoc meetings, and calls with outside
  guests, none of which leave the usual traces.
  It also no longer leaves a stray few-second recording behind, which used to stop the
  real meeting from being recorded later.

### Added
- **Leaving a meeting you are alone in now asks what you meant.** Stepping out for a
  moment and finishing the meeting look the same from the outside, so Garely asks: leave
  and keep the meeting open for whoever arrives next, or end it and produce the report.
  Ending this way always produces the report, however short the meeting was. Guests, quick
  meetings, and leaving a meeting that still has people in it are unchanged.

## [1.25.0-beta.3] — 2026-08-06

Fixes from a full audit of the codebase.

### Fixed
- **The "Transcription" switch still did nothing.** It was wired up last release, but the
  lookup the transcription service uses never returned the setting, so it carried on
  transcribing regardless of what the meeting said. It now actually stops.
- **Edits to the same task could overwrite each other.** Two people changing different
  fields of one task at the same time — one the description, one the due date — and the
  second save silently discarded the first. Both changes are now kept.
- **Deleting a task left parts of it behind in ClickUp.** If the task had subtasks that
  were mirrored, those copies stayed in ClickUp with nothing left in Garely pointing at
  them. The whole task, subtasks included, is now removed on both sides — and a subtask
  belonging to Linear correctly blocks the delete, as it already did for a whole task.
- **Tasks survived the meeting they belonged to.** Deleting a meeting left its tasks in
  the board forever, referring to a meeting that no longer existed, and nobody except an
  admin could edit or remove them. They are now cleaned up with the meeting. Tasks already
  pushed to ClickUp are deliberately left there — deleting a meeting here should not
  destroy work someone has started elsewhere.
- **A task could be filed into a meeting you cannot open.** It then appeared as an action
  item in that meeting's report, and revealed the meeting's title and time. Filing a task
  into a meeting now requires access to it.

### Housekeeping
- Reminder emails could go out twice: the scheduler was running the same jobs both on the
  host and inside the app, so every reminder fired from two places at once. The duplicate
  schedule has been removed.
- Freed 20 GB on the server (accumulated build leftovers) and added a weekly clean-up so
  it does not build up again.

## [1.25.0-beta.2] — 2026-08-05

Tasks can now be deleted on both sides, meetings can be told not to create tasks at
all, and ClickUp keeps ownership of priorities.

### Added
- **Deleting a task in Garely now deletes it in ClickUp too.** Until now it did not
  work at all in that direction: a task that had been mirrored simply refused to
  delete, which is why every synced task stayed put no matter what you did with it.
  It now goes from both sides — including every assignee's copy when a task was split
  between several people, and any subtasks. If ClickUp cannot be reached, the task
  stays in Garely rather than quietly disappearing here while living on there, and
  you are told how many copies were removed so you can retry.
  Deleting a mirrored task is limited to an admin or the person it is assigned to,
  and it asks for confirmation first, since it destroys the ClickUp task for everyone.
- **A per-meeting switch for creating tasks.** Turn it off and the meeting still
  produces a full report — summary, decisions, topics — but no tasks at all, neither
  in Garely nor in ClickUp. Existing meetings are unaffected: everything keeps
  creating tasks unless you say otherwise.

### Changed
- **Garely no longer sets task priority in ClickUp.** Tasks arrive there with no
  priority, so the team decides it in ClickUp and a later sync never overwrites that
  choice. Priorities already set on existing tasks are left alone.

### Fixed
- **The "Transcription" and "AI report" switches did nothing.** Both had been saved
  with the meeting and carried into recurring occurrences for a long time, but nothing
  ever read them — turning transcription off still transcribed, turning the report off
  still generated it. All three switches now do what they say.

## [1.25.0-beta.1] — 2026-08-01

One remote-desktop client instead of two, and tabs that no longer break after an update.

### Removed
- **The experimental "V2 (beta)" remote desktop is gone.** Remote desktop had shipped two
  parallel clients — the standard one and an opt-in V2 — and V2 proved the less reliable of
  the pair in daily use. The standard client is now the only one: the V1/V2 switch has been
  removed from the connect screen and every session uses the standard client automatically.
  Nothing to change on your side; existing servers, access rules, clipboard and file transfer
  all work exactly as before. This also retires the extra background services V2 needed.

### Fixed
- **A tab left open during an update stopped working.** After a new version was deployed, any
  tab opened beforehand could hit an error and keep silently retrying, so buttons appeared to
  do nothing until the page was manually force-reloaded. Such a tab now detects that it is out
  of date and refreshes itself.

### Meeting reports
- **Meeting participants were listed as "not registered".** In the report's reassignment
  dropdown, someone who joined under a display name different from their account name was
  matched by name only, so they showed up a second time as an unregistered guest. Speakers are
  now matched to their actual account, and people who spoke without being on the invite list
  are assignable too.

### Elsewhere
- **Dropdown lists closed while being scrolled.** Long lists (such as the report's assignee
  picker) dismissed themselves as soon as you scrolled inside them, which made them feel
  disabled. They now stay open.

## [1.24.0-beta.6] — 2026-07-28

A full security-and-reliability audit pass: closes access-control holes, stops the
disk and backups from silently failing, and makes rejected edits and dropped
sessions visible instead of vanishing.

### Security
- **Anyone with a Google account could sign in.** Google sign-in had no sign-up gate, so
  any Google account could log in and be enrolled as an active workspace member. New
  accounts are now admitted only when their email domain is on the allowlist; existing
  members always keep access.
- **A disabled account could still reach the API.** Disabling a user hid the app but left
  every API route reachable with their existing session. Disabled accounts are now rejected
  at the API too.
- **A private meeting could be joined by any member.** Anyone signed in could request a join
  token for a meeting by its id, even one with guests turned off. Private meetings now check
  membership before issuing a token; open meetings are unaffected.

### Fixed
- **A failed database backup could destroy a good one.** If the nightly dump failed midway it
  was still scored a success and could rotate out the last valid backup. The dump is now
  written aside and only swapped in when it completes intact.
- **The disk slowly filled with orphaned recording files.** Recording files with no database
  reference, and per-speaker audio, were never cleaned up — a full disk eventually stops the
  database from writing. Both are now pruned on the daily sweep.
- **AI reports could hang, and Linear could get duplicate issues.** A report whose generation
  stalled would sit "generating" forever; it now times out and is marked failed. And retrying
  a Linear issue after a transient error could create a second copy; it now retries only when
  nothing was actually created.
- **Reminders, invites and due dates showed the wrong time.** They were formatted in the
  server's UTC clock instead of the workspace timezone, and recurring meetings drifted an hour
  across daylight-saving changes. Everything now uses the workspace timezone and keeps the
  wall-clock time across DST.
- **Two people editing the same task could lose an edit.** Simultaneous edits to different
  fields of one row raced and the later save clobbered the earlier one. Edits to a row are now
  serialised so both are kept.
- **Reconnecting ClickUp duplicated every task.** Turning the ClickUp integration off and back
  on re-created a second copy of every already-synced task. Re-enabling now re-adopts the
  existing task instead of duplicating it.
- **The dashboard ordered "my tasks" by priority wrong.** Priority sorted alphabetically, so
  *low* appeared above *medium*. It now ranks high → medium → low.
- **Edits that failed to save looked saved, then vanished.** In the task drawer, report action
  items and grid cells, a rejected save was silently ignored and the change reappeared undone
  on the next refresh. A failed save is now reverted and shown with a visible error.
- **A dropped RDP session showed a black screen.** When an RDP v2 connection dropped it left a
  black screen with no explanation. It now shows what happened and a button to reconnect.

## [1.24.0-beta.5] — 2026-07-21

### Fixed
- **Opening Garely while already signed in showed the login page.** A bookmark (or a
  second tab) pointing straight at the login URL always rendered the sign-in form, even
  for a user who was already logged in — the login page never redirected an authenticated
  visitor into the app. It now bounces a signed-in user straight to where they were headed
  (or the home page), and still shows the form for a genuinely signed-out or stale session.

## [1.24.0-beta.4] — 2026-07-21

Meeting-report transcripts line up on one timeline, ClickUp changes flow back into Garely,
and RDP v2 starts sharp every time.

### Fixed
- **Transcript timeline was offset from real time.** Each speaker's timestamps were measured
  from the moment that person joined, so different speakers sat on different, unrelated clocks
  — a line spoken 3 minutes in could show as "0:02". Every speaker is now placed on one
  meeting-wide timeline, so the transcript reads in true order and matches when things were
  actually said. Applies to meetings recorded from now on; existing transcripts are left as
  they are (so older reports' citation links keep working).
- **Tasks looked stuck in Garely after they'd moved on in ClickUp.** Renames made in ClickUp
  never came back (the reverse sync only listened for status changes and deletions), so a task
  renamed there kept its old AI-generated title here and seemed lost. Renames now sync back.
  And custom ClickUp stages — "in control", "routine", anything a team adds between "to do" and
  "done" — are now shown as *In progress* instead of *Open*, by ClickUp's own status type so it
  works in any language.

### Added
- **Hourly ClickUp catch-up sync.** The live ClickUp→Garely webhook is fire-and-forget, so a
  delivery missed during a deploy or a rate-limit used to drift forever. An hourly sweep now
  reconciles every linked task's status and name, and quietly prunes dead links. It is
  deletion-guarded: a task merely moved between lists is never mistaken for a deleted one.
- **RDP v2 remembers HD and starts in it.** HD was per-session and defaulted off, so you had to
  toggle it every time to get the crisp, device-pixel picture. It now defaults on and remembers
  your choice.

## [1.24.0-beta.3] — 2026-07-17

The AI can now write meeting content in Russian, chosen by an admin — independent of the
interface language.

### Added
- **AI report language (admin toggle).** Settings → Workspace has a new "AI report language"
  picker (Ukrainian / Russian / English). It sets the language the AI writes in — meeting
  reports, task titles, decisions, summaries, weekly rollups, the meeting chat, and the live
  in-call notes — separately from the interface language. A workspace whose interface is
  Ukrainian can now generate Russian meeting content. Left unset, the AI keeps following the
  interface language, so nothing changes for existing workspaces.
- **Russian action-item detection.** The live agent now recognizes Russian task cues
  ("нужно", "надо", "сделать", "срок", "дедлайн", …). Previously a Russian action item was
  filtered out before the AI ever looked at it, so live task suggestions were missed on
  Russian-language calls.

### Changed
- The AI output language is resolved in one place across the whole app and the live agent,
  replacing a scattered Ukrainian-or-English choice that silently produced English for any
  other language. The interface language set (Ukrainian / English) is unchanged.

## [1.24.0-beta.2] — 2026-07-17

ClickUp routing stops guessing: you now map each department to a ClickUp list by hand, pin
a person's tasks to their own list, and give the transcription a glossary so it stops
mangling your product names.

### Added
- **Manual department → ClickUp list mapping.** Each department's destination list is now
  chosen by an admin from a live picker in Settings → Departments, stored on the department
  itself. Routing no longer matches your department names against ClickUp Space names —
  which broke whenever a name drifted, silently picked whichever list a Space happened to
  order first, and forced one customer's naming quirk to be hardcoded in the product. A
  department with no list falls back to the list you pick as the fallback (Settings →
  Integrations → ClickUp); with no fallback either, its tasks stay in Garely. Unmapped
  departments show a warning chip so the gaps are visible.
- **Per-user ClickUp list (C-level routing).** In Settings → Users you can pin one person's
  tasks to a single ClickUp list, and their tasks go there from *any* call regardless of the
  task's department. It out-ranks department routing and the automatic personal list, and
  works whether or not per-assignee routing is on.
- **Transcription glossary.** Settings → Workspace takes a list of terms the speech-to-text
  keeps getting wrong — product names, tools, internal jargon. They boost Deepgram
  recognition (measured on real calls: a product name spoken inside another language was
  transcribed at 0.99 confidence as a different, wrong word, and the glossary recovers it)
  and correct the spelling of those exact terms in the AI report, including for meetings
  already recorded.

### Fixed
- **Garbled task names.** A task titled from a misheard product name (the transcript said
  one thing, the recognizer wrote another) is now corrected via the glossary rather than
  copied verbatim into ClickUp. This was a speech-to-text error, not the AI inventing names.
- **The re-transcription path ignored your Deepgram model setting** and was pinned to one
  model, so a re-transcribed speaker could come back sounding different from the rest of the
  call. It now uses the configured model, with the matching term-boost syntax for it.

### Changed
- The department→list link changed meaning: the field that used to cache an auto-guessed
  list is now the admin's explicit choice and is never overwritten automatically. Existing
  installs are seeded once from the old behavior, then edited in the picker. Already-pushed
  ClickUp tasks are not relocated (ClickUp can't move a task between lists) — the new mapping
  applies to new tasks.

## [1.24.0-beta.1] — 2026-07-17

Meeting tasks stop duplicating and landing on the wrong people, and RDP v2 can finally
ask Windows to scale its UI.

### Fixed
- **Duplicate ClickUp tasks (one assigned, one not).** Task creation caught *every* error
  and retried without assignees. That is only safe for a 400 (request refused, nothing
  created) — it also fired on timeouts and 5xx, where ClickUp had already created the task,
  leaving an orphaned assigned copy plus a linked unassigned one. Only a 400 retries now,
  and the status and assignees are dropped in separate steps so a status name the list
  doesn't define can no longer cost a valid assignee.
- **Whole departments falling into the Call Inbox.** List discovery only asked for
  *folderless* lists, so a ClickUp Space whose lists live inside Folders looked empty —
  no mapping, no error — and every one of that department's tasks went to the Inbox even
  though the department plainly existed. Folders are read too, and a Space with no
  reachable list now warns instead of failing silently.
- **Tasks assigned to the wrong person, and multi-assignee tasks collapsing to one.**
  Name matching was an unanchored substring test, so a short name captured an unrelated
  longer one ("Al" matched "Natalia") and the winner could change between runs. Matching is
  now exact-then-whole-word, and an ambiguous name resolves to nobody: an unassigned task
  is visible and fixable, a task on the wrong person is not.
- **All-hands tasks dumped onto one team's board.** A task with no explicit department
  inherited its *assignee's* department, so shared work followed whoever the AI named first.
  A task without a department now goes to the Call Inbox for triage. Expect more Inbox
  volume — that is the point.
- **Renaming a department stranded it.** The department→list link was a pure name match
  against ClickUp Space names. Each successful resolve is now pinned, and the pin is used
  when the name no longer matches. An explicit list-map override still wins.

### Added
- **RDP v2 can request Windows UI scaling.** Upstream `guacd` never sends the RDP
  `desktopScaleFactor` (and zeroes it on every resize), so a HiDPI client could only shrink
  the picture, never make Windows scale — HD was crisp but tiny. Garely now ships a patched
  `guacd` (`rdp-gw2/desktop-scale.patch`) that adds a `desktop-scale` parameter, and HD
  renders at device-pixel density while asking for 150% UI scaling.
  *Note:* a Windows target configured with `IgnoreClientDesktopScaleFactor=1` discards the
  request — no RDP client can override that; it must be changed on the server.

### Changed
- **RDP v2 scale is two fixed modes** — normal and HD — instead of a picker, and switching
  reconnects. Concurrent reconnects could previously let an older scale win while the UI
  showed the newer one, so the on-screen scale could disagree with what was rendered.

## [1.23.0-beta.4] — 2026-07-17

### Changed
- **RDP v2 scale is now a −/+ stepper.** The pill's binary HD toggle is replaced by a
  live scale stepper (1.0×–2.5×, 0.25 steps) so you can dial the exact size: lower for a
  bigger UI, higher for sharper text. The choice persists per browser. guacd can't scale
  the Windows UI (unlike v1's IronRDP, which used DesktopScaleFactor), so the render
  resolution is the only lever — this hands that lever to the user. For fully crisp text
  at a normal UI size on a Retina display, set the Windows target's display scale to 200%
  and raise the stepper to 2×.

## [1.23.0-beta.3] — 2026-07-17

### Fixed
- **RDP v2 resolution.** Normal mode renders at 1.5× the viewport (the comfortable
  default); the pill's HD toggle now bumps to 2× for maximum device-pixel sharpness
  (smaller UI) on demand, replacing the old toggle-off state that dropped to 1× and
  looked both too large and soft. guacd sets no Windows scale factor, so resolution is
  the only lever — 1.5× is the crisp-vs-size sweet spot on HiDPI displays. (For fully
  crisp text at a normal UI size on a Retina display, set the Windows target's display
  scale to 200% and switch on HD.)

## [1.23.0-beta.2] — 2026-07-17

Follow-up fixes to the RDP v2 beta.

### Fixed
- **Two-way file transfer was silently broken.** `guacd` runs as a non-root user, but
  the redirected-drive volume was created root-owned, so guacd couldn't create the
  per-user folder ("Unable to create directory … Permission denied") and every
  transfer failed. The drive volume is now world-writable (re-asserted on cron start),
  so uploads/downloads work.
- **Default resolution too soft on Retina.** v2 now opens at 1.5× the viewport —
  sharper text at a comfortable UI size — instead of 1×. The pill's HD toggle drops to
  1× for a larger UI. (guacd sets no Windows scale factor, so resolution is the only
  lever; 1.5× is the crisp-vs-size sweet spot.)

## [1.23.0-beta.1] — 2026-07-17

RDP v2 — a second, opt-in way to reach managed servers, built on Apache Guacamole
(native `guacd` decode) to fix the motion lag and input bugs of the v1 in-browser
IronRDP client. v2 runs alongside v1: users pick **Standard** or **V2 (beta)** on the
connect screen (or `?v=2`), and v1 stays the default until v2 is proven, so nothing
about the existing flow changes.

### Added
- **RDP v2 on Apache Guacamole (opt-in, coexists with v1).** `guacd` 1.6 +
  guacamole-lite tunnel + guacamole-common-js client, isolated behind a compose
  profile so v1 (Devolutions Gateway) is untouched. Native multi-threaded decode +
  copy-rect scrolling fixes the v1 sluggishness on remote scroll/redraw.
- **Client parity with v1.** Draggable floating control pill (position persisted);
  full-viewport takeover with correct scaling from the first frame; transform- and
  fullscreen-safe mouse; bidirectional text clipboard; Mac ⌘→Ctrl shortcuts
  (⌘A/⌘C/⌘V/⌘X/⌘Z/⌘S and ⌘⇧ combos) that actually reach the Windows target; and a
  keepalive that stops a backgrounded tab from freezing the session.
- **Two-way file transfer** via RDP drive redirection: an Upload button and drag-drop
  send files to a per-user "Garely" drive on the server; a drive panel browses and
  downloads files copied there from the server side. A nightly job prunes staged
  files older than 7 days so the shared host disk can't be exhausted.
- **HD toggle.** Comfortable resolution by default (normal-size Windows UI, since
  guacd can't scale the remote UI); an optional per-session HD mode renders 1.5× for
  sharper text.

### Security
- The v2 RDP password is injected into the AES-256-CBC guac token **server-side and
  never returned to the browser** — a strict improvement over v1's connect, which
  hands the cleartext password to the in-browser client for NLA.
- Per-user redirected-drive path, so one user's uploaded or staged files are never
  visible inside another user's session.

## [1.22.0-beta.1] — 2026-07-16

Security hardening (credential exposure), plus meeting/ClickUp and screen-share
improvements. The security work came out of an incident-response assessment of how
credentials could be extracted from Garely or a managed RDP host.

### Security
- **Revocable sessions.** Garely sessions were stateless 30-day JWTs with no
  server-side revocation — a stolen session cookie survived password changes for
  weeks, and the only way to invalidate all sessions was to rotate the master secret
  (which also destroys every encrypted credential, since it is the same key). A new
  per-user `sessionEpoch` lets you sign a user (or everyone) out everywhere WITHOUT
  touching `AUTH_SECRET`. Existing sessions are grandfathered, so the change logs
  nobody out on deploy.
- **Throttled the RDP credential reveal.** `POST /servers/[id]/connect` returns the
  server password to the browser (the in-browser client performs NLA itself); it is
  now rate-limited per user so a compromised session cannot iterate it to dump the
  whole fleet's credentials in a burst. Corrected a misleading code comment.
- **Per-IP login throttle** on password sign-in (on top of the existing per-email
  bucket), fail-open on an unknown IP so a proxy misconfig never locks anyone out.
- **SMTP credential re-point guard.** Changing the SMTP host to a different server
  without supplying a new password now clears the stored password, so it can't be
  transmitted to an attacker-controlled server via "send test".
- **Ops:** tightened the production `.env` to mode 0600 (was world-readable).

### Added
- **Unconfirmed meeting tasks route to the ClickUp Call Inbox.** When the AI routes a
  task to a department that had nobody from the meeting present, it now goes to the
  shared Call Inbox as one triage task assigned to all attendees, instead of landing
  unassigned in that department's list.

### Fixed
- **Sharper screen sharing.** Screen share ran on SDK defaults (VP8, 1080p@15,
  2.5 Mbps, no content hint), so text smeared on scroll. Added a `text` content hint,
  raised the bitrate ceiling to 4 Mbps, and trimmed the simulcast ladder — all scoped
  to the screen-share track (camera untouched).
- **Stale RDP audit sessions are reaped.** The disconnect beacon is best-effort, so a
  killed tab left audit rows stuck "active" forever; the cleanup cron now closes them
  with a real end time (never affecting live-presence, which keys on heartbeats).

### Changed
- The RDP gateway compose overlay is now tracked in git and pinned to a tested image
  version, instead of living only on the production host.

### Deferred (documented, not shipped)
- Separating the encryption key from the session-signing key, key-rotation tooling,
  encrypting three provider secrets at rest, mandatory 2FA, and splitting the internal
  API secret — each carries prod-migration or live-integration risk and is tracked for
  supervised rollout.

## [1.21.0-beta.1] — 2026-07-09

In-browser RDP (Remote Access) reliability.

### Added
- **File-clipboard toggle in the session pill.** Turn the shared file clipboard off
  to work with files INSIDE the server without server-side file copies auto-downloading
  to your machine (and without drag-drop upload). The text clipboard is a separate
  channel and always stays on.

### Fixed
- **Sessions no longer drop after ~5 minutes in a background tab.** An inaudible
  keepalive stops the browser from freezing the backgrounded tab (which severed the
  WebSocket); auto-reconnect-on-focus remains the fallback.
- **Stuck Shift after a macOS system shortcut.** ⌘⇧5 (screenshot) and similar could
  strand Shift “down” on the server; it's now released on your next keystroke. Scoped
  to Shift so it never disturbs ⌘C / ⌘V paste.
- **Horizontal touchpad scroll.** Two-finger horizontal swipes now scroll the remote
  desktop — the client previously dropped horizontal wheel deltas (rebuilt the vendored
  IronRDP web component to send each axis independently).

## [1.20.0-beta.1] — 2026-07-03

### Added
- **ClickUp fallback insight.** Settings → Integrations → ClickUp now shows how
  many tasks landed in the fallback list (“Call Inbox”) in the last 30 days (and
  all-time), so you can tell at a glance whether the fallback is still catching
  unrouted tasks before deciding to remove it. Loaded on demand when the modal
  opens.

## [1.19.0-beta.1] — 2026-07-03

Per-user ClickUp routing, and sharper AI task extraction.

### Added
- **Per-user ClickUp routing.** Settings → Integrations → ClickUp → “Personal
  lists for cross-department people”. When on, a meeting task is created as one
  ClickUp task **per assignee**, and anyone who belongs to 2+ departments (e.g.
  admins) gets their tasks in their **own auto-created list** under a “Garely
  Personal” space instead of a department space — so cross-department admins’
  tasks no longer clutter department spaces. Single-department members keep their
  department routing. Status still syncs both ways (last change wins). Off by
  default; existing behaviour is unchanged. Enable it before the first connect for
  a clean rollout — tasks already pushed in the old mode aren’t moved.

### Fixed
- **The AI no longer records in-meeting logistics as tasks.** In-call requests
  like “share your screen”, “unmute”, “next slide”, and anything done on the spot
  during the call are excluded from task extraction — only genuine follow-up work
  that outlives the meeting becomes a task. Applies to newly generated reports;
  regenerate an older report to re-apply.

### Notes
- Additive schema change (`ClickUpTaskLink.rowId` + `assigneeUserId`) applied ahead of the deploy.

## [1.18.0-beta.1] — 2026-06-23

HubSpot CRM integration — turn finished meetings into CRM activity.

### Added
- **HubSpot CRM.** Settings → Integrations → CRM: paste a HubSpot Private App
  token and turn it on. When a meeting's AI report is generated, Garely finds
  each participant's contact by email and logs the meeting (summary + decisions
  + report link) as a Meeting activity associated to everyone from the call who
  exists in HubSpot. One-way Garely → CRM, opt-in, fire-and-forget and fail-soft
  — never delays or breaks report generation. Optionally auto-create a contact
  for an unknown participant email. The token is encrypted at rest and never
  returned to the browser. Provider is stored so Pipedrive / Salesforce can be
  added on the same pattern later.

### Changed
- **Provider pricing moved to the Usage tab.** The per-provider rates (DeepSeek
  in/out, Deepgram/min, email limit) now live in Settings → Usage, next to the
  cost figures they compute, and the spend updates as soon as you save them.

## [1.17.0-beta.1] — 2026-06-23

Generic outbound webhooks — wire Garely into Zapier, Make, n8n or any HTTP
endpoint. One connector, hundreds of automations.

### Added
- **Outbound webhooks.** Settings → Integrations → Webhooks: add one or more
  HTTPS endpoints, each subscribed to the events you care about, and Garely
  POSTs a JSON payload whenever they fire. Events: `report.ready` (a meeting's
  AI report is generated), `meeting.reminder` (ahead of a call), `task.created`
  and `task.updated`. An endpoint with no events selected receives every event.
- **Signed, verifiable deliveries.** Each POST carries `X-Garely-Signature:
  sha256=<HMAC-SHA256 of the body>` (GitHub-compatible) signed with the
  endpoint's secret, plus `X-Garely-Event`, `X-Garely-Delivery` and
  `X-Garely-Timestamp` headers so receivers can verify authenticity and dedupe.
  Secrets are encrypted at rest and never returned to the browser. Delivery is
  opt-in, fire-and-forget and fail-soft — a slow or broken endpoint never delays
  or breaks the meeting, report or task flow that triggered it. Send a test ping
  per endpoint from the settings modal.

### Notes
- No schema change — webhook config lives in workspace settings; app-only deploy.

## [1.16.0-beta.1] — 2026-06-23

Tier 1 integrations: outbound chat notifications, a pluggable AI-model provider
with an API-driven model picker, and a full two-way Linear sync — plus the AI
provider is no longer locked to DeepSeek.

### Added
- **Chat notifications → Telegram / Slack / Mattermost / Discord.** Settings →
  Integrations → Chat: paste a Telegram bot token + chat id, or a Slack /
  Mattermost / Discord incoming-webhook URL, and turn it on. Meeting AI reports
  (summary + decisions + link) post when generated, and meeting reminders post
  ahead of the call. Secrets are encrypted at rest; opt-in, non-blocking, and
  never delays or breaks report generation.
- **Pluggable AI model provider.** The AI integration is now provider-agnostic —
  pick DeepSeek, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama (local), or any custom
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint in Settings → Integrations → AI model. Click **Load
  models** to pull the provider's model list into a dropdown (or type a custom
  id), and set an optional **Max output tokens** ceiling — auto-filled from the
  model's reported limit where the provider exposes it. Existing DeepSeek setups
  keep working unchanged. Reach Claude via OpenRouter (`anthropic/claude-opus-4-8`)
  or Anthropic directly.
- **Two-way Linear sync — AI tasks ↔ Linear issues.** Paste a Linear API key in
  Settings → Integrations → Linear and turn it on; teams, members (matched by
  email) and workflow states are auto-discovered. Tasks route to the team
  matching each department; any task whose assignee exists in Linear becomes a
  **read-only mirror** in Garely (badge + link) while Linear owns it. Workflow-
  state changes and deletions flow **back** via a signed webhook (HMAC-SHA256
  with a replay guard). On connect, existing assigned tasks migrate; on
  disconnect, tasks return to native Garely editing. Tasks with no Linear
  assignee stay native. Opt-in and a no-op until configured.

### Fixed
- **Meeting-chat assistant honours the configured AI model.** It was hardcoded to
  a DeepSeek model id and would have failed against other providers; it now uses
  whichever model the workspace has selected.

## [1.15.0-beta.1] — 2026-06-23

A two-way ClickUp integration that can hand task management over to ClickUp, plus
the in-meeting briefing — description and agenda now visible during the call.

### Added
- **Two-way ClickUp integration — ClickUp becomes the primary task manager.**
  Paste a ClickUp Personal API token in Settings → Integrations and turn it on;
  everything else (workspace, members, department→list routing, the "Source"
  field) is auto-discovered. Any task whose assignee exists in ClickUp (matched
  by email) is pushed to the list matching its department, tagged **Source =
  Garely Call**, and becomes a **read-only mirror** in Garely (board, report
  action items and the detail drawer show a "Managed in ClickUp" badge + link;
  edits happen in ClickUp). Status changes and deletions flow **back** from
  ClickUp via a signed webhook (HMAC-SHA256). On connect, all existing assigned
  tasks migrate to ClickUp; on disconnect the webhook is removed and tasks return
  to native Garely editing. Tasks with no ClickUp assignee stay native. Opt-in,
  non-blocking, and a no-op until configured.

### Changed
- **Meetings show their description and agenda during the call.** A new "Agenda"
  tab in the meeting room — and the agenda card in the lobby — lists the meeting's
  description and numbered agenda items, so everyone sees the briefing without
  leaving the call. Quick meetings with no briefing simply don't show it.

## [1.14.1-beta.1] — 2026-06-11

Google Calendar auto-connect, database ownership transfer, and an iOS 26 Liquid
Glass mobile navigation bar.

### Added
- **Transfer ownership of databases and individual tables.** A base owner or a
  workspace admin can hand a database to another member (the outgoing owner is
  kept on with admin access); each table now has its own owner who can rename,
  delete and manage that table even without base-admin rights, transferable from
  the table's ⋯ menu. Who can *see* a table stays at the base level.

### Changed
- **Mobile navigation rebuilt as an iOS 26 Liquid Glass tab bar.** A translucent
  floating capsule — four tabs (Dashboard, Calendar, Tasks, Decisions) plus a
  detached circular **More** button that morphs the tabs to the rest (Database,
  Servers, Archive, Settings). Content scrolls through the glass, the selection
  capsule springs between tabs, and the bar minimizes on scroll. It stays on
  every screen, so any section is one tap away.
- **Google Calendar connects automatically on Google sign-in.** Signing in with
  Google now also enables two-way calendar sync — no separate "Connect" step.
  The Settings → Profile connect/disconnect card stays for password accounts and
  as a manual fallback. (Best-effort and fully isolated from the login flow — a
  Google hiccup never blocks or breaks signing in.)

### Removed
- **Retired the read-only ICS subscription feed** (the "Calendar sync" link in
  Settings → Profile and its `/api/calendar/*` endpoints) — superseded by the
  two-way Google Calendar integration. Note: meeting/task-deadline visibility in
  Outlook/Apple Calendar via that feed is no longer available; the two-way Google
  sync covers meetings.

### Fixed
- **Rescheduling a missed meeting reopens it instead of leaving it "completed".**
  An overdue meeting that someone briefly opened (so it was marked ended) and
  then moved to a new time now returns to the upcoming state — no more phantom
  "report" on a meeting that never happened. Genuine meetings with a real report
  are never touched.
- **The dashboard stops showing finished meetings as "next".** Once a meeting's
  scheduled end time passes (start + duration), it no longer appears as the next
  meeting or in the upcoming list; meetings in progress still show.
- **Deleting a meeting that has a recording no longer fails silently.** The
  archive now explains that a recording is attached and offers a single
  "delete the meeting and its recording" action, with a clear error otherwise.
- **Task status now syncs between the Tasks board and the AI report.** Ticking an
  action item in a report persists like the board does (and reverts if the server
  rejects it); an in-progress task is shown distinctly instead of as not-started.
  Board status changes also revert on failure rather than appearing to succeed.
- **View-only database access is now truly read-only.** Members shared a database
  with the *viewer* role can no longer edit cells, set or replace 2FA codes and
  passwords, upload files, or add/remove rows, fields and records — while still
  being able to read everything (including viewing a 2FA code or revealing a
  password). The whole grid, kanban, calendar and record view respect the role.
- **2FA codes stay in sync with your authenticator.** The rotating code now
  anchors to an absolute window boundary from the server and re-fetches at each
  rotation (and when you return to the tab), so a backgrounded tab no longer
  shows a code from a window that already expired.
- **The meeting description and agenda are now visible during the call.** Notes
  and discussion points added when scheduling a meeting now appear in an
  **Agenda** side-panel inside the room, and in the lobby before you join — not
  only on the calendar. The panel is shown whenever a meeting has a description
  or agenda items.

## [1.14.0-beta.1] — 2026-06-10

**The "calendar that just works" release.** Garely now lives inside Google
Calendar two ways, every meeting link is the same link everywhere, and
colleagues who click "the same meeting" land in the same room.

### Added
- **Two-way Google Calendar sync.** Connect your Google account in Settings →
  Profile: a dedicated **"Garely"** calendar is created in your account and kept
  in sync both directions. Events you add, edit or delete there become Garely
  meetings (with a room, join link and attendees mapped to members/guests); and
  meetings you schedule, reschedule or cancel in Garely appear/update/disappear
  there with the join link written into the event. Per-user OAuth (works for
  password accounts too), tokens encrypted at rest, scoped to the one calendar —
  personal events are never touched. Near-instant via Google push channels with
  a 10-minute cron poller as a fallback; an etag loop-guard prevents echo loops.
- **Send files to a remote server's clipboard from the RDP status pill** — an
  upload button left of the server name uploads picked files straight into the
  remote machine's clipboard (same path as drag-and-drop).

### Fixed
- **One canonical meeting link everywhere.** The calendar invite, the `.ics`,
  the "Add to Google Calendar" button and the in-room "copy link" now all hand
  out the same token-based `/join/<token>` URL. Signed-in colleagues land
  straight in the lobby; guests get the guest flow; a raw `/room/<id>` is no
  longer a dead end. Signing in from a `/join` link returns you to the lobby
  (honours `callbackUrl`).
- **Recurring meetings no longer split people across rooms.** The join token now
  migrates to each new occurrence, so the link saved in a calendar always opens
  the current room; recurring invites ship a single `RRULE` event instead of
  copies. Finished/cancelled occurrences return 410 (and a recurring series
  redirects to the next live occurrence) instead of resurrecting a dead room.
- **Quick-meeting URLs are now shareable** — `/room/quick` rewrites to the real
  meeting id once created, and the lazy room name is deterministic so two people
  joining a legacy meeting in the same second can't end up in different rooms.

## [1.13.0-beta.1] — 2026-06-06

**The "work OS" release.** Garely grows from a meeting app into a self-hosted
work platform: a built-in database, tasks rebuilt on top of it, and an AI layer
that turns meetings into decisions and assigned work — all on your own server.

### Added
- **Rebrand to Garely.** New name, interlock logo mark + wordmark, and docs
  (formerly EZmeet / EAM Meet). Product brand is decoupled from your workspace name.
- **Multi-tenancy foundation.** Every record now belongs to an Organization
  (single-database, `orgId`-scoped throughout) — the groundwork for a clean
  self-host first-run and a future hosted/multi-org cloud.
- **A native database engine** (Airtable / Teable-style), built in: Base → Table →
  Field → Record → Views (**grid, kanban, calendar**), ~18 field types (text,
  long text, number, currency, percent, rating, single/multi-select, date, person,
  checkbox, URL, email, phone, file/attachment, **TOTP 2FA code**, encrypted
  **password**, and two-way **link/relations**), filters & sorts, resizable and
  drag-reorderable columns & rows, a row context menu (insert ×N / duplicate /
  copy link / comment / delete), multi-select + bulk actions, **record comments**
  and attachments, and **per-base sharing by email** (roles + hidden columns).
- **Tasks, rebuilt on the engine.** Tasks are now records in that database, which
  unlocks **custom fields on tasks** — set them on create, edit them in the task
  drawer, see them as chips on the board, and filter the board by select fields.
  Plus multiple assignees and inline subtasks.
- **AI that does the work (the moat):**
  - The AI now **fills your custom task fields** straight from the meeting transcript.
  - **Decisions registry** — every decision your meetings make is extracted into a
    searchable registry (with owners), organised by meeting, with per-decision
    access control, inline **edit/delete**, and a backfill for existing reports.
  - A **weekly "where to focus" AI rollup** at the top of the digest email.
  - AI auto-assigns people, subtasks and the right department to action items.
- **Remote access — in-browser RDP** *(folded into this beta on 2026-06-09):*
  - **Connect to your RDP servers from the browser**, no client to install — a
    Rust/WASM **IronRDP** client streams the desktop through a self-hosted
    **Devolutions Gateway** (RDCleanPath over WSS); the page is the full client
    (display, keyboard, mouse, **NLA/CredSSP**).
  - **Encrypted credential vault** (AES-256-GCM) with **per-server access control**
    by user or department; every connection is audit-logged.
  - **Shared clipboard** both ways, **file drag-and-drop**, **dynamic 1:1 resolution**
    that follows the browser window and re-fits live, and **live presence** — everyone
    with access sees when a server is in use and by whom.
  - **Keyboard-layout sync** — Unicode keyboard mode types the character you pressed
    (Ukrainian, Russian, etc.) regardless of the server's active layout; a macOS
    **⌘→Ctrl** mapping with self-healing modifier state so a swallowed ⌘ keyup (e.g.
    after switching input source) never leaves typing stuck.
  - **Draggable session status pill** — reposition the server/disconnect chip anywhere
    over the canvas; the position persists across reconnects.

### Changed / Fixed
- **Self-host first-run hardening.** The Google-SSO setup path now provisions the
  first Organization (a fresh Google-only install no longer comes up without an
  org); integration status detects Google credentials via the database **and** env;
  `.env.example` spells out which services matter (DeepSeek = core, SMTP =
  recommended, Deepgram = opt-in).
- Meeting invitations send the `.ics` as a proper calendar alternative with a
  correct ORGANIZER/ATTENDEE; reports show **all** assignees, not just the lead.
- Database home bento layout, grid viewport-fit, and assorted polish.
- Calendar month view no longer nests interactive controls: a day cell is now a
  keyboard-operable container (not a `<button>`), so the task-deadline chips
  inside it are valid — clearing the React hydration warning.
- **Tasks — dense, sortable table.** The desktop list/department views are now a
  proper data-grid (Task · Priority · Assignee · Due · Subtasks · Department/Status)
  with click-to-sort headers, tabular dates, overdue/soon colour, and an inline
  "add a task" row per group; mobile keeps the stacked cards, Kanban is unchanged.
- **Meetings — entry window + "Start now".** A scheduled meeting can be joined only
  from 5 minutes before it starts; earlier, only the host/admin can start it via a
  "Start now" button (enforced server-side in the join-token route). This also fixes
  a bug where opening a future meeting early flipped it to `live` and an empty-room
  webhook then ended it — wrongly dropping it into the archive. The cleanup cron no
  longer auto-ends meetings whose start is still in the future.
- **Calendar keeps history.** Past, ended and cancelled meetings now stay on the
  calendar greyed-out instead of vanishing; the Archive remains the dedicated list.
- **Recording rework — stable, automatic, screen-aware.** The recorder no longer uses a
  CPU-heavy room-composite grid (which tore the video and broke the audio on a modest
  host). New `screen-audio` mode (`WS_RECORD_MODE`): the screen-share is captured as a
  passthrough TrackEgress (no transcode, no headless browser) and the whole room's mixed
  audio via a light audio-only egress, then muxed offline with ffmpeg into one MP4 — the
  screen placed on the timeline by real media-start so audio and screen stay in sync.
  Recording is now **fully automatic** (starts with the meeting; the manual in-room
  toggle is gone, the REC indicator stays). Deleting a meeting that has a recording is
  blocked so recordings can't silently vanish.

## [1.12.0-beta.1] — 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Personal calendar subscription (ICS).** Each user gets a private feed URL
  in *Settings → Calendar sync* to subscribe to **their own meetings and task
  deadlines** from Google Calendar, Outlook or Apple Calendar. One-way, the
  secret URL is the credential, and regenerating it revokes old subscriptions.
- **Email notifications for tasks.** You get an email (and in-app notification)
  when a task is **assigned** to you, and when a task's **status or due date
  changes** — sent to the assignee and collaborators, never to the person who
  made the change, and only on a real change. Honours the per-user task
  notification toggle.
- **Email + calendar invitations for meetings.** Scheduling a meeting now emails
  everyone (creator + participants/guests) an invitation with an attached `.ics`
  plus **Join**, **Add to Google Calendar** and **Add to calendar (.ics)** buttons
  — so it drops straight into Google / Outlook / Apple Calendar. Rescheduling
  sends an update; deleting sends a cancellation.

### Changed
- **Manage subtasks inline on the Tasks board.** Each task row has a disclosure
  caret that expands its subtasks in place — toggle status, see the assignee,
  delete, and quick-add (Enter) without opening the task. The parent row shows a
  progress meter (done / total).
- **Task details open in a side panel** — a right-hand, full-height drawer
  instead of a centred modal, keeping subtasks, comments, files and collaborators
  together; on phones it becomes a full-screen sheet.
- **Animated sign-in background** — a subtle, accent-tinted "flowing paths"
  backdrop on the login screen (CSS-only, hair-thin lines, honours
  `prefers-reduced-motion`).

## [1.11.0-beta.1] — 2026-06-03

**Departments & a real task workspace.** Tasks gain org structure, collaboration,
and a role-aware calendar — turning the post-meeting task list into a place work
actually happens.

### Added
- **Departments (org structure).** Admins create departments (name + colour) in
  *Settings → Departments* and assign members (with an optional lead). Meetings
  and tasks can belong to a department. A task's **effective department** is its
  explicit one, else its **assignee's** department — so moving a person into a
  department automatically attributes their tasks to it.
- **Access gating by department.** Non-admins see their **own** tasks, their
  **meetings'** tasks, their **department's** tasks, and tasks they **collaborate**
  on; admins see everything. The Tasks board adds a **By department** grouped view
  and a department filter; admins also get a department filter on the calendar.
- **Subtasks.** Break a task into a checklist of subtasks (one level), each
  toggleable and assignable; the board shows a subtask count.
- **Comments.** A threaded discussion per task. The assignee, collaborators and
  the task's department are notified of new comments; explicit @mentions notify
  the mentioned teammate (gated to people who can already see the task).
- **File attachments.** Upload files to a task (stored in a dedicated Docker
  volume, 25 MB each); download is authenticated and always served as an
  attachment. Uploader or an admin can delete.
- **Collaborators.** Add extra people to a task beyond the assignee; they get the
  task in their lists, on their calendar, and a notification when added.
- **Tasks on the calendar, role-scoped.** Task (and subtask) deadlines appear on
  the calendar within each person's access scope; clicking one opens the task.

### Changed
- The Tasks page modal now hosts the full task workspace — details plus a
  **Subtasks / Comments / Files** panel and a collaborators row.

## [1.10.0-beta.1] — 2026-05-30

A **mobile & in-meeting UX** pass. This entry also **consolidates the 1.6.0–1.9.0
betas** (those standalone releases were retired in favour of one rolling release).

### Added
- **Start a quick meeting from mobile.** The mobile compose (+) button is now a
  **speed-dial** offering *Quick meeting* (start now) or *Schedule*, and the
  dashboard exposes both as cards — previously phones could only schedule.

### Changed
- **Simplified in-meeting controls.** The bottom bar went from ~14 flat buttons
  to a focused core — mic, camera, screen share, reactions — plus a **⋮ More**
  menu (record, invite, device pickers) and a single **Panel** button. The five
  separate side-panel buttons (participants, chat, transcript, notes, AI) are now
  **tabs inside one panel**. On phones the bar stays compact: screen share and the
  device pickers fold into the ⋮ menu.
- **Quizzes moved into the Tasks page** as a `Tasks | Quizzes` tab (web + mobile),
  with the pending-quiz reminder badge now on Tasks. This frees a slot in the
  mobile bottom bar; `/quizzes` redirects to the new tab.

### Fixed
- The in-call **device pickers now show the device actually in use** (and the
  default speaker) instead of "Not found".

### Also in this release (consolidated from 1.6.0–1.9.0)

- **Comprehension quizzes** (was 1.9.0). From a finished meeting's report, an
  admin or the creator can generate AI multiple-choice questions, edit / add /
  remove them, choose open- or closed-book, and assign to participants. Assignees
  take a mobile-friendly, **auto-graded** quiz (one attempt); creators are
  notified of each result. A "Quizzes" hub shows everyone their assigned quizzes
  and gives admins/creators each participant's score with an answer review.
  Quizzes can be deleted.
- **Recording rebuild** (was 1.8.0). **On-demand recording** — start/stop from a
  Record button inside the meeting (host/admin) instead of an all-or-nothing
  setting; the REC indicator now reflects the real recording state for everyone.
  Transcript segments from one continuous turn are **coalesced** into
  paragraph-sized rows.
- **Recurring meetings & polish** (was 1.7.0). Recurring meetings
  **auto-materialize** their next occurrence (missed slots skipped); report and
  archive render times in the **workspace timezone**; accessibility aria-labels on
  icon-only buttons.
- **Security & reliability** (was 1.6.0). Tightened **authorization** on tasks,
  recordings and per-speaker tracks; upgraded `nodemailer` (clears an
  SMTP-injection advisory); added security headers (CSP `frame-ancestors` /
  `X-Frame-Options` / `nosniff` / `Referrer-Policy`); report generation status
  with a Retry button; **automated daily DB backups** (rotated, kept 14); a
  state-cleanup cron; ops hardening (healthchecks, log rotation, memory limits);
  a clean `scheduled → live → ended` meeting status machine; DB indexes.

## [1.5.0-beta.1] — 2026-05-26

A foundational **quality & hardening** release driven by a code audit — no new
user-facing features, plus one user-facing fix.

### Added
- Test suite expanded **24 → 122** across 21 files: integration tests for the 12
  most security-critical API routes (set-password token lifecycle, tasks
  scope/authorization, invite, admin password reset, self-registration
  anti-enumeration, webhook auth, join-token, guest join, admit, recording
  access) plus unit tests for the core authz primitive, route guards,
  rate-limiter, validation, error wrapper, password and i18n parity. Prisma
  deep-mock test harness.
- Structured JSON logger and a `withRoute()` error wrapper adopted across the
  API — uniform try/catch + structured error logs (routes without error handling
  went **36 → 1**).
- Error tracking via a Sentry-envelope reporter (self-hosted GlitchTip
  compatible), enabled by setting `SENTRY_DSN`.
- Redis-backed rate limiting with a transparent in-process fallback.
- `zod` request-body validation (foundation + task creation).
- Test-coverage reporting: `npm run test:coverage`.

### Changed
- Split the four largest components into focused files: settings 1581→69,
  calendar 1983→350 (fully), report 2245→1813 and room 1405→1205 (lib +
  presentational extracted).
- Typed the NextAuth session/JWT — removed **124 `as any` casts** (318 → 194).
- Extracted shared primitives (secret resolution, SSE parser, HTTP/route-guard
  helpers, email escaping, UI Spinner/Modal/useTransientMessage).
- The production 2FA secret now fails closed (never falls back to a dev constant).

### Fixed
- Dashboard React #418 hydration error: dates/times render against the workspace
  timezone so server and client produce identical markup.

## [1.4.0-beta.1] — 2026-05-26

### Added
- Grounded per-meeting **AI chat** on the report (streaming answers, clickable
  transcript citations).
- Calendar shows **task deadlines** alongside scheduled meetings.
- Invited users **set their own password** via a one-time link.
- Admins are **emailed on new self-registrations**; admins can **rename users**.

### Changed
- Admin Users list redesigned into a single aligned row.

### Fixed
- User-facing email links now use the public URL (were pointing at the internal
  Docker host).

## [1.3.0-beta.1] — 2026-05-25

### Added
- Topic-structured **"Detailed" reports** with clickable transcript citations;
  the extended report is also included in the PDF export.

## [1.2.0-beta.1] — 2026-05-25

### Added
- **Per-speaker multilingual transcription** (uk/ru/en): per-participant Deepgram
  STT, post-meeting language detection (with a UI-language prior to break the
  uk↔ru tie), and a report "fix language & regenerate" flow.

## [1.0.0-beta.1]

### Added
- Initial public beta: video meetings (LiveKit SFU), live transcription, AI
  summaries / action items, collaborative notes, reactions, optional recording,
  installable PWA with push notifications, full uk/en i18n, and a self-hosted
  one-command installer with automatic HTTPS.
