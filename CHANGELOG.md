# Changelog

All notable changes to Garely are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project currently
ships `beta` tags ahead of a 1.0 public release.

## [1.14.1-beta.1] — 2026-06-11

Google Calendar auto-connect, database ownership transfer, and an iOS 26 Liquid
Glass mobile navigation bar.

### Added
- **Transfer ownership of databases and individual tables.** A base owner or a
  workspace admin can hand a database to another member (the outgoing owner is
  kept on with admin access); each table now has its own owner who can rename,
  delete and manage that table even without base-admin rights, transferable from
  the table's ⋯ menu. Who can *see* a table stays at the base level.

### Changed
- **Mobile navigation rebuilt as an iOS 26 Liquid Glass tab bar.** A translucent
  floating capsule — four tabs (Dashboard, Calendar, Tasks, Decisions) plus a
  detached circular **More** button that morphs the tabs to the rest (Database,
  Servers, Archive, Settings). Content scrolls through the glass, the selection
  capsule springs between tabs, and the bar minimizes on scroll. It stays on
  every screen, so any section is one tap away.
- **Google Calendar connects automatically on Google sign-in.** Signing in with
  Google now also enables two-way calendar sync — no separate "Connect" step.
  The Settings → Profile connect/disconnect card stays for password accounts and
  as a manual fallback. (Best-effort and fully isolated from the login flow — a
  Google hiccup never blocks or breaks signing in.)

### Removed
- **Retired the read-only ICS subscription feed** (the "Calendar sync" link in
  Settings → Profile and its `/api/calendar/*` endpoints) — superseded by the
  two-way Google Calendar integration. Note: meeting/task-deadline visibility in
  Outlook/Apple Calendar via that feed is no longer available; the two-way Google
  sync covers meetings.

## [1.14.0-beta.1] — 2026-06-10

**The "calendar that just works" release.** Garely now lives inside Google
Calendar two ways, every meeting link is the same link everywhere, and
colleagues who click "the same meeting" land in the same room.

### Added
- **Two-way Google Calendar sync.** Connect your Google account in Settings →
  Profile: a dedicated **"Garely"** calendar is created in your account and kept
  in sync both directions. Events you add, edit or delete there become Garely
  meetings (with a room, join link and attendees mapped to members/guests); and
  meetings you schedule, reschedule or cancel in Garely appear/update/disappear
  there with the join link written into the event. Per-user OAuth (works for
  password accounts too), tokens encrypted at rest, scoped to the one calendar —
  personal events are never touched. Near-instant via Google push channels with
  a 10-minute cron poller as a fallback; an etag loop-guard prevents echo loops.
- **Send files to a remote server's clipboard from the RDP status pill** — an
  upload button left of the server name uploads picked files straight into the
  remote machine's clipboard (same path as drag-and-drop).

### Fixed
- **One canonical meeting link everywhere.** The calendar invite, the `.ics`,
  the "Add to Google Calendar" button and the in-room "copy link" now all hand
  out the same token-based `/join/<token>` URL. Signed-in colleagues land
  straight in the lobby; guests get the guest flow; a raw `/room/<id>` is no
  longer a dead end. Signing in from a `/join` link returns you to the lobby
  (honours `callbackUrl`).
- **Recurring meetings no longer split people across rooms.** The join token now
  migrates to each new occurrence, so the link saved in a calendar always opens
  the current room; recurring invites ship a single `RRULE` event instead of
  copies. Finished/cancelled occurrences return 410 (and a recurring series
  redirects to the next live occurrence) instead of resurrecting a dead room.
- **Quick-meeting URLs are now shareable** — `/room/quick` rewrites to the real
  meeting id once created, and the lazy room name is deterministic so two people
  joining a legacy meeting in the same second can't end up in different rooms.

## [1.13.0-beta.1] — 2026-06-06

**The "work OS" release.** Garely grows from a meeting app into a self-hosted
work platform: a built-in database, tasks rebuilt on top of it, and an AI layer
that turns meetings into decisions and assigned work — all on your own server.

### Added
- **Rebrand to Garely.** New name, interlock logo mark + wordmark, and docs
  (formerly EZmeet / EAM Meet). Product brand is decoupled from your workspace name.
- **Multi-tenancy foundation.** Every record now belongs to an Organization
  (single-database, `orgId`-scoped throughout) — the groundwork for a clean
  self-host first-run and a future hosted/multi-org cloud.
- **A native database engine** (Airtable / Teable-style), built in: Base → Table →
  Field → Record → Views (**grid, kanban, calendar**), ~18 field types (text,
  long text, number, currency, percent, rating, single/multi-select, date, person,
  checkbox, URL, email, phone, file/attachment, **TOTP 2FA code**, encrypted
  **password**, and two-way **link/relations**), filters & sorts, resizable and
  drag-reorderable columns & rows, a row context menu (insert ×N / duplicate /
  copy link / comment / delete), multi-select + bulk actions, **record comments**
  and attachments, and **per-base sharing by email** (roles + hidden columns).
- **Tasks, rebuilt on the engine.** Tasks are now records in that database, which
  unlocks **custom fields on tasks** — set them on create, edit them in the task
  drawer, see them as chips on the board, and filter the board by select fields.
  Plus multiple assignees and inline subtasks.
- **AI that does the work (the moat):**
  - The AI now **fills your custom task fields** straight from the meeting transcript.
  - **Decisions registry** — every decision your meetings make is extracted into a
    searchable registry (with owners), organised by meeting, with per-decision
    access control, inline **edit/delete**, and a backfill for existing reports.
  - A **weekly "where to focus" AI rollup** at the top of the digest email.
  - AI auto-assigns people, subtasks and the right department to action items.
- **Remote access — in-browser RDP** *(folded into this beta on 2026-06-09):*
  - **Connect to your RDP servers from the browser**, no client to install — a
    Rust/WASM **IronRDP** client streams the desktop through a self-hosted
    **Devolutions Gateway** (RDCleanPath over WSS); the page is the full client
    (display, keyboard, mouse, **NLA/CredSSP**).
  - **Encrypted credential vault** (AES-256-GCM) with **per-server access control**
    by user or department; every connection is audit-logged.
  - **Shared clipboard** both ways, **file drag-and-drop**, **dynamic 1:1 resolution**
    that follows the browser window and re-fits live, and **live presence** — everyone
    with access sees when a server is in use and by whom.
  - **Keyboard-layout sync** — Unicode keyboard mode types the character you pressed
    (Ukrainian, Russian, etc.) regardless of the server's active layout; a macOS
    **⌘→Ctrl** mapping with self-healing modifier state so a swallowed ⌘ keyup (e.g.
    after switching input source) never leaves typing stuck.
  - **Draggable session status pill** — reposition the server/disconnect chip anywhere
    over the canvas; the position persists across reconnects.

### Changed / Fixed
- **Self-host first-run hardening.** The Google-SSO setup path now provisions the
  first Organization (a fresh Google-only install no longer comes up without an
  org); integration status detects Google credentials via the database **and** env;
  `.env.example` spells out which services matter (DeepSeek = core, SMTP =
  recommended, Deepgram = opt-in).
- Meeting invitations send the `.ics` as a proper calendar alternative with a
  correct ORGANIZER/ATTENDEE; reports show **all** assignees, not just the lead.
- Database home bento layout, grid viewport-fit, and assorted polish.
- Calendar month view no longer nests interactive controls: a day cell is now a
  keyboard-operable container (not a `<button>`), so the task-deadline chips
  inside it are valid — clearing the React hydration warning.
- **Tasks — dense, sortable table.** The desktop list/department views are now a
  proper data-grid (Task · Priority · Assignee · Due · Subtasks · Department/Status)
  with click-to-sort headers, tabular dates, overdue/soon colour, and an inline
  "add a task" row per group; mobile keeps the stacked cards, Kanban is unchanged.
- **Meetings — entry window + "Start now".** A scheduled meeting can be joined only
  from 5 minutes before it starts; earlier, only the host/admin can start it via a
  "Start now" button (enforced server-side in the join-token route). This also fixes
  a bug where opening a future meeting early flipped it to `live` and an empty-room
  webhook then ended it — wrongly dropping it into the archive. The cleanup cron no
  longer auto-ends meetings whose start is still in the future.
- **Calendar keeps history.** Past, ended and cancelled meetings now stay on the
  calendar greyed-out instead of vanishing; the Archive remains the dedicated list.
- **Recording rework — stable, automatic, screen-aware.** The recorder no longer uses a
  CPU-heavy room-composite grid (which tore the video and broke the audio on a modest
  host). New `screen-audio` mode (`WS_RECORD_MODE`): the screen-share is captured as a
  passthrough TrackEgress (no transcode, no headless browser) and the whole room's mixed
  audio via a light audio-only egress, then muxed offline with ffmpeg into one MP4 — the
  screen placed on the timeline by real media-start so audio and screen stay in sync.
  Recording is now **fully automatic** (starts with the meeting; the manual in-room
  toggle is gone, the REC indicator stays). Deleting a meeting that has a recording is
  blocked so recordings can't silently vanish.

## [1.12.0-beta.1] — 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Personal calendar subscription (ICS).** Each user gets a private feed URL
  in *Settings → Calendar sync* to subscribe to **their own meetings and task
  deadlines** from Google Calendar, Outlook or Apple Calendar. One-way, the
  secret URL is the credential, and regenerating it revokes old subscriptions.
- **Email notifications for tasks.** You get an email (and in-app notification)
  when a task is **assigned** to you, and when a task's **status or due date
  changes** — sent to the assignee and collaborators, never to the person who
  made the change, and only on a real change. Honours the per-user task
  notification toggle.
- **Email + calendar invitations for meetings.** Scheduling a meeting now emails
  everyone (creator + participants/guests) an invitation with an attached `.ics`
  plus **Join**, **Add to Google Calendar** and **Add to calendar (.ics)** buttons
  — so it drops straight into Google / Outlook / Apple Calendar. Rescheduling
  sends an update; deleting sends a cancellation.

### Changed
- **Manage subtasks inline on the Tasks board.** Each task row has a disclosure
  caret that expands its subtasks in place — toggle status, see the assignee,
  delete, and quick-add (Enter) without opening the task. The parent row shows a
  progress meter (done / total).
- **Task details open in a side panel** — a right-hand, full-height drawer
  instead of a centred modal, keeping subtasks, comments, files and collaborators
  together; on phones it becomes a full-screen sheet.
- **Animated sign-in background** — a subtle, accent-tinted "flowing paths"
  backdrop on the login screen (CSS-only, hair-thin lines, honours
  `prefers-reduced-motion`).

## [1.11.0-beta.1] — 2026-06-03

**Departments & a real task workspace.** Tasks gain org structure, collaboration,
and a role-aware calendar — turning the post-meeting task list into a place work
actually happens.

### Added
- **Departments (org structure).** Admins create departments (name + colour) in
  *Settings → Departments* and assign members (with an optional lead). Meetings
  and tasks can belong to a department. A task's **effective department** is its
  explicit one, else its **assignee's** department — so moving a person into a
  department automatically attributes their tasks to it.
- **Access gating by department.** Non-admins see their **own** tasks, their
  **meetings'** tasks, their **department's** tasks, and tasks they **collaborate**
  on; admins see everything. The Tasks board adds a **By department** grouped view
  and a department filter; admins also get a department filter on the calendar.
- **Subtasks.** Break a task into a checklist of subtasks (one level), each
  toggleable and assignable; the board shows a subtask count.
- **Comments.** A threaded discussion per task. The assignee, collaborators and
  the task's department are notified of new comments; explicit @mentions notify
  the mentioned teammate (gated to people who can already see the task).
- **File attachments.** Upload files to a task (stored in a dedicated Docker
  volume, 25 MB each); download is authenticated and always served as an
  attachment. Uploader or an admin can delete.
- **Collaborators.** Add extra people to a task beyond the assignee; they get the
  task in their lists, on their calendar, and a notification when added.
- **Tasks on the calendar, role-scoped.** Task (and subtask) deadlines appear on
  the calendar within each person's access scope; clicking one opens the task.

### Changed
- The Tasks page modal now hosts the full task workspace — details plus a
  **Subtasks / Comments / Files** panel and a collaborators row.

## [1.10.0-beta.1] — 2026-05-30

A **mobile & in-meeting UX** pass. This entry also **consolidates the 1.6.0–1.9.0
betas** (those standalone releases were retired in favour of one rolling release).

### Added
- **Start a quick meeting from mobile.** The mobile compose (+) button is now a
  **speed-dial** offering *Quick meeting* (start now) or *Schedule*, and the
  dashboard exposes both as cards — previously phones could only schedule.

### Changed
- **Simplified in-meeting controls.** The bottom bar went from ~14 flat buttons
  to a focused core — mic, camera, screen share, reactions — plus a **⋮ More**
  menu (record, invite, device pickers) and a single **Panel** button. The five
  separate side-panel buttons (participants, chat, transcript, notes, AI) are now
  **tabs inside one panel**. On phones the bar stays compact: screen share and the
  device pickers fold into the ⋮ menu.
- **Quizzes moved into the Tasks page** as a `Tasks | Quizzes` tab (web + mobile),
  with the pending-quiz reminder badge now on Tasks. This frees a slot in the
  mobile bottom bar; `/quizzes` redirects to the new tab.

### Fixed
- The in-call **device pickers now show the device actually in use** (and the
  default speaker) instead of "Not found".

### Also in this release (consolidated from 1.6.0–1.9.0)

- **Comprehension quizzes** (was 1.9.0). From a finished meeting's report, an
  admin or the creator can generate AI multiple-choice questions, edit / add /
  remove them, choose open- or closed-book, and assign to participants. Assignees
  take a mobile-friendly, **auto-graded** quiz (one attempt); creators are
  notified of each result. A "Quizzes" hub shows everyone their assigned quizzes
  and gives admins/creators each participant's score with an answer review.
  Quizzes can be deleted.
- **Recording rebuild** (was 1.8.0). **On-demand recording** — start/stop from a
  Record button inside the meeting (host/admin) instead of an all-or-nothing
  setting; the REC indicator now reflects the real recording state for everyone.
  Transcript segments from one continuous turn are **coalesced** into
  paragraph-sized rows.
- **Recurring meetings & polish** (was 1.7.0). Recurring meetings
  **auto-materialize** their next occurrence (missed slots skipped); report and
  archive render times in the **workspace timezone**; accessibility aria-labels on
  icon-only buttons.
- **Security & reliability** (was 1.6.0). Tightened **authorization** on tasks,
  recordings and per-speaker tracks; upgraded `nodemailer` (clears an
  SMTP-injection advisory); added security headers (CSP `frame-ancestors` /
  `X-Frame-Options` / `nosniff` / `Referrer-Policy`); report generation status
  with a Retry button; **automated daily DB backups** (rotated, kept 14); a
  state-cleanup cron; ops hardening (healthchecks, log rotation, memory limits);
  a clean `scheduled → live → ended` meeting status machine; DB indexes.

## [1.5.0-beta.1] — 2026-05-26

A foundational **quality & hardening** release driven by a code audit — no new
user-facing features, plus one user-facing fix.

### Added
- Test suite expanded **24 → 122** across 21 files: integration tests for the 12
  most security-critical API routes (set-password token lifecycle, tasks
  scope/authorization, invite, admin password reset, self-registration
  anti-enumeration, webhook auth, join-token, guest join, admit, recording
  access) plus unit tests for the core authz primitive, route guards,
  rate-limiter, validation, error wrapper, password and i18n parity. Prisma
  deep-mock test harness.
- Structured JSON logger and a `withRoute()` error wrapper adopted across the
  API — uniform try/catch + structured error logs (routes without error handling
  went **36 → 1**).
- Error tracking via a Sentry-envelope reporter (self-hosted GlitchTip
  compatible), enabled by setting `SENTRY_DSN`.
- Redis-backed rate limiting with a transparent in-process fallback.
- `zod` request-body validation (foundation + task creation).
- Test-coverage reporting: `npm run test:coverage`.

### Changed
- Split the four largest components into focused files: settings 1581→69,
  calendar 1983→350 (fully), report 2245→1813 and room 1405→1205 (lib +
  presentational extracted).
- Typed the NextAuth session/JWT — removed **124 `as any` casts** (318 → 194).
- Extracted shared primitives (secret resolution, SSE parser, HTTP/route-guard
  helpers, email escaping, UI Spinner/Modal/useTransientMessage).
- The production 2FA secret now fails closed (never falls back to a dev constant).

### Fixed
- Dashboard React #418 hydration error: dates/times render against the workspace
  timezone so server and client produce identical markup.

## [1.4.0-beta.1] — 2026-05-26

### Added
- Grounded per-meeting **AI chat** on the report (streaming answers, clickable
  transcript citations).
- Calendar shows **task deadlines** alongside scheduled meetings.
- Invited users **set their own password** via a one-time link.
- Admins are **emailed on new self-registrations**; admins can **rename users**.

### Changed
- Admin Users list redesigned into a single aligned row.

### Fixed
- User-facing email links now use the public URL (were pointing at the internal
  Docker host).

## [1.3.0-beta.1] — 2026-05-25

### Added
- Topic-structured **"Detailed" reports** with clickable transcript citations;
  the extended report is also included in the PDF export.

## [1.2.0-beta.1] — 2026-05-25

### Added
- **Per-speaker multilingual transcription** (uk/ru/en): per-participant Deepgram
  STT, post-meeting language detection (with a UI-language prior to break the
  uk↔ru tie), and a report "fix language & regenerate" flow.

## [1.0.0-beta.1]

### Added
- Initial public beta: video meetings (LiveKit SFU), live transcription, AI
  summaries / action items, collaborative notes, reactions, optional recording,
  installable PWA with push notifications, full uk/en i18n, and a self-hosted
  one-command installer with automatic HTTPS.
