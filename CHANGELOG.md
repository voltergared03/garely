# Changelog

All notable changes to EZmeet are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project currently
ships `beta` tags ahead of a 1.0 public release.

## [1.5.0-beta.1] — 2026-05-26

A foundational **quality & hardening** release driven by a code audit — no new
user-facing features, plus one user-facing fix.

### Added
- Test suite expanded **24 → 122** across 21 files: integration tests for the 12
  most security-critical API routes (set-password token lifecycle, tasks
  scope/authorization, invite, admin password reset, self-registration
  anti-enumeration, webhook auth, join-token, guest join, admit, recording
  access) plus unit tests for the core authz primitive, route guards,
  rate-limiter, validation, error wrapper, password and i18n parity. Prisma
  deep-mock test harness.
- Structured JSON logger and a `withRoute()` error wrapper adopted across the
  API — uniform try/catch + structured error logs (routes without error handling
  went **36 → 1**).
- Error tracking via a Sentry-envelope reporter (self-hosted GlitchTip
  compatible), enabled by setting `SENTRY_DSN`.
- Redis-backed rate limiting with a transparent in-process fallback.
- `zod` request-body validation (foundation + task creation).
- Test-coverage reporting: `npm run test:coverage`.

### Changed
- Split the four largest components into focused files: settings 1581→69,
  calendar 1983→350 (fully), report 2245→1813 and room 1405→1205 (lib +
  presentational extracted).
- Typed the NextAuth session/JWT — removed **124 `as any` casts** (318 → 194).
- Extracted shared primitives (secret resolution, SSE parser, HTTP/route-guard
  helpers, email escaping, UI Spinner/Modal/useTransientMessage).
- The production 2FA secret now fails closed (never falls back to a dev constant).

### Fixed
- Dashboard React #418 hydration error: dates/times render against the workspace
  timezone so server and client produce identical markup.

## [1.4.0-beta.1] — 2026-05-26

### Added
- Grounded per-meeting **AI chat** on the report (streaming answers, clickable
  transcript citations).
- Calendar shows **task deadlines** alongside scheduled meetings.
- Invited users **set their own password** via a one-time link.
- Admins are **emailed on new self-registrations**; admins can **rename users**.

### Changed
- Admin Users list redesigned into a single aligned row.

### Fixed
- User-facing email links now use the public URL (were pointing at the internal
  Docker host).

## [1.3.0-beta.1] — 2026-05-25

### Added
- Topic-structured **"Detailed" reports** with clickable transcript citations;
  the extended report is also included in the PDF export.

## [1.2.0-beta.1] — 2026-05-25

### Added
- **Per-speaker multilingual transcription** (uk/ru/en): per-participant Deepgram
  STT, post-meeting language detection (with a UI-language prior to break the
  uk↔ru tie), and a report "fix language & regenerate" flow.

## [1.0.0-beta.1]

### Added
- Initial public beta: video meetings (LiveKit SFU), live transcription, AI
  summaries / action items, collaborative notes, reactions, optional recording,
  installable PWA with push notifications, full uk/en i18n, and a self-hosted
  one-command installer with automatic HTTPS.
